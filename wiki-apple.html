			<p class="larger">An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree.</p>
			<p>An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica).</p>
			<p>Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus..</p>
			<p>The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today.</p>
			<p> Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by
				European colonists.</p>
			<p> Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and
				European Christian tradition.</p>
			<p>Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit
				frequently lacks desired</p>
			<p>characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks.</p>
			<p> Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. </p>
			<p>Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for
				easier harvesting.</p>
			<a class="underline" id="TAN"><strong> more info about nutrition</strong></a>
